# LBM Fluid Simulator
This project was a project for a competition.<br>
It is **a fluid simulator using Lattice-Boltzmann Method with nice GUI** (two GUI versions, Tkinter and PyQt5). I started the project in September, 2021. And the result came that I won the first prize in March, 2023. There isn't any secret now, so I'm uploading to share my work. I hope this can help someone. <br>

## Tips:
1. **Please be sure to run the program in the program's root floder**. There is still some logic issues in the program (that I'm too lazy and busy to solve now), especially when doing file operations like screenshotting and saving project. It will possibly accidentally create some .PNG or .LBM files if you are not running the code in the code's root directory, and there may be issues while running without "Screenshots" floder, icon files, and .ttf file(if PyQt5 version). So make sure you "cd" to the projects floder first then "py main.py".
