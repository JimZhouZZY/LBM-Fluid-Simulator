# LBM Fluid Simulator
This project was a project for a competition.<br>
It is **a fluid simulator using Lattice-Boltzmann Method with nice GUI** (two GUI versions, Tkinter and PyQt5). I started the project in September, 2021. And the result came that I won the first prize in March, 2023. So there isn't any secret now. I'm uploading to share my work <br>
